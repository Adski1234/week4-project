Installation Instructions

Here is where I would put them if I had a clue how.




Reflections

- My Brain is fried. Trying to remeber which parts of things needed to be applied to which program was very confusing.
- Once I worked out what went where then I found databases quite logical
- Apologies for the very basic styling, my original plan have a wall which each user entry 'tagged' in a grafiti style but it got too complicated so I reverted to basic styling with a correctly functioning website.
- I much prefer databases and server stuff than css and design.
- If there are any weird bits of code left it may be where I junked the wall plan.
- I spent hours on the deployment and tried many fixes.
 - Not my best work this week unfortunatly
